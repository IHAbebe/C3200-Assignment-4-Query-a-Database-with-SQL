1. (5 pts) What are the last names and emails of all customer who made purchased in the store?
2. (5 pts) What are the names of each album and the artist who created it?
3. (10 pts) What are the total number of unique customers for each state, ordered alphabetically by state?
4. (10 pts) Which states have more than 10 unique customers?
5. (10 pts) What are the names of the artists who made an album containing the substring "symphony" in the album title?
6. (15 pts) What are the names of all artists who performed MPEG (video or audio) tracks in either the "Brazilian Music" or the "Grunge" playlists?
7. (20 pts) How many artists published at least 10 MPEG tracks?

9. (25 pts) Creative addition: Define a new meaningful query using at least three tables, and some window function. Explain clearly what your query achieves, and what the results mean
